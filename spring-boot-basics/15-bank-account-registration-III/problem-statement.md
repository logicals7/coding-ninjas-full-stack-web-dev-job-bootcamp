## Note  

1. Don't change the versions of **Spring Boot (3.0.0)** and **Java (17)**. If needed, then install the same.  

2. Do not move the `ApplicationContext.xml` file.  

3. Bean ID should be the same as the class name but in **camel-case** version (refer to `ApplicationContext.xml` file).  

4. **Do not modify** the template code as it may produce inaccurate results. Keeping the original code intact is crucial to ensure correct output.
