## Problem Statement
Continuing the Bank Account Registration application, we now have to implement the concepts of IOC, Dependency Injection, and Bean Life Cycle using Annotations. Complete the application accordingly.

## Instructions

- You are supposed to use the camel-case naming convention for writing the bean name inside the `@Component` Annotation where required.

**Example:**  
I have a class with the name `savingsAccount`, and the bean name for it will be `"savingsAccount"`.
