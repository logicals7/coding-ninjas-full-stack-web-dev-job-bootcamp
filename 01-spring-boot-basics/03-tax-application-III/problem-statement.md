## ‚úÖ Tasks

1. Go to the `TaxApplication` class & perform the following steps in order to complete the tax application.

2. Check if the user has paid the tax already, if yes then print the below message on console:

   > "You have already paid Income/Property (get this from `getTaxType()` interface method) tax."

3. If the user has not paid tax then do the following:

    - Take the input of income/property value from the user based on the choice made & set this amount using `setTaxableAmount()` interface method.

    - Finally, calculate the `taxAmount` using `calculateTaxAmount()` interface method & ask user if he wants to pay the tax. If yes, then call `payTax()` method.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

1. Don't change the versions of Spring Boot (`3.0.0`) and Java (`17`). If needed, then install the same.

2. Do not move the `"ApplicationContext"` file.

3. Bean ID should be the same as the class name but in **camel-case** version (refer to `ApplicationContext` file).

4. Do not modify the template code as it may produce inaccurate results. Keeping the original code intact is crucial to ensure correct output.
